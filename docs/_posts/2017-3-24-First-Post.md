title: First Blog Post of Project
---

Today I was able to set up a github as well as a webpage hosted on github
for my project. I implemented a blog page so that I can write up-to-date
blog posts about the progress that I have made so far. There is also an
about page that describes the project in more detail.

I also found a few tutorials online to help me use my data and display it 
on a map. My next goal is to get familiar with the mapbox api so that I 
can use it to display data points on a map. Once I get that working I want
to add a page to my website that will allow me to show my results.
