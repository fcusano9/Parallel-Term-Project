title: Predicting an Earthquake
---

After doing extensive research I have found many articles about predicting earthquakes.
Some of the main factors that I have found to be most important are:
- Minor earthquakes often lead to larger ones
- Earthquakes occur on fault lines in almost all cases
- Volcanic activity can cause earthquakes
