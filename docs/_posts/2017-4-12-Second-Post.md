title: Mapping Data
---

So far I believe I have all of the data that I need in order to
accurately predict when future earthquakes will occur. I was able
to get the data to display on a map with the help of some online
tutorials on using webmercator as well as the mapbox api.

My next plan is to do some research on how I can accurately predict
when a future earthquake will occur given past data. After that I
need to write a data parser in c++ so that I can use openMP for
the implentation of my algorithms.
