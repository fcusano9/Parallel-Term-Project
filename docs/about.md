Hi, my name is Frank Cusano and I am a junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This is my
term project for my Parallel Computing class (ECSE 4740).

### Project Information

This program takes earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and uses
it to predict when a future earthquake will occur.
